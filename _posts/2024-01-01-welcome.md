## Initial situation

The main reason for this implementation project is to breathe new life and possibly even added value into older hardware with alternative and up-to-date software.

A search on the net using the term [Sercomm NA502](https://www.google.com/search?q=sercomm+na502) brought up results that were worth looking into further.

The hit on [OpenWrt.org](https://openwrt.org/toh/sercomm/na502) and the fact that we had a Sercomm NA502 gateway in my drawer led to the decision to try the conversion.

Our gateway is an "A1 Smart Home Gateway", but there are also Sercomm variants from other providers, such as „MiOS“, "Vera", "Hornbach" and other brands.

The following step-by-step documentation should help to remember the steps in detail and also make it easy for others to follow them.

In the end, the aim is to have a modern WiFi access point that also provides the Zwave and ZigBee controllers via the home network for new alternative smart home solutions.

> For OpenWrt experts who may find the step-by-step instructions published here too lengthy and/or detailed, there is a short, concise version on the [OpenWrt website](https://openwrt.org/toh/sercomm/na502).
