## Initial situation and motivation

The main reason for this implementation project is to breathe new life and possibly even added value into older hardware with alternative and up-to-date software.

A search on the net using the term [**Sercomm NA502**](https://www.google.com/search?q=sercomm+na502){:target="_blank"} brought up results that were worth looking into further.

The hit on [**OpenWrt.org**](https://openwrt.org/toh/sercomm/na502){:target="_blank"} and the fact that we had a [**Sercomm NA502**](https://www.google.com/search?q=sercomm+na502){:target="_blank"} gateway in the drawer led to the decision to try upcycling.

Our gateway is an [**A1 Smart Home Gateway**](https://www.google.com/search?q=A1%20Smart%20Home){:target="_blank"}, but there are also Sercomm variants from other providers, such as [**Hornbach**](https://www.google.com/search?q=Hornbach+Smart+Home){:target="_blank"}, [**Vera**](https://www.google.com/search?q=Vera+Smart+Home){:target="_blank"}, [**MiOS**](https://www.google.com/search?q=MiOS+Smart+Home){:target="_blank"} and other brands.

The following step-by-step documentation should help to remember the steps in detail and also make it easy for others to follow them.

In the end, an additional modern **`WiFi access point`** will be available for the home network, which will also provide the **`Zwave`** and **`ZigBee`** controllers via the home network for new alternative smart home solutions, like **`Home Assistant`**. **`OpenHAB`**, **`ioBroker`**, etc.

>For OpenWrt experts who may find the step-by-step instructions published here too lengthy and/or detailed, there is a short, concise version on the [**OpenWrt website**](https://openwrt.org/toh/sercomm/na502){:target="_blank"}.
